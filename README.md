Logo

An "atomic codes" logo often blends scientific atomic symbols (nucleus with orbiting electrons, trefoil radiation symbol) with digital/tech elements (code brackets, binary), aiming for a modern, intelligent feel, but the most famous "atomic" icon is the ionizing radiation trefoil (black on yellow) or the atom emoji (⚛️), 
representing science, energy, or technology, with variations found on stock sites for diverse applications like tech companies, energy, or even gaming
